The Rules Of Checkers.
The basic rules of checkers are as follows. Players take turns making moves. Black moves first. To win, all your opponent's checkers (or "men") must be captured or blocked so that they cannot move. The player making the last move of the game wins. In Play Computer mode, the computer plays red and you play black. You therefore get the advantage of going first.
At the start of the game all checkers are "uncrowned" men and may advance toward the opposite side of the board diagonally from one black square to another vacant black square. If a diagonal square is unoccupied, the checker can move to that square. If a diagonal square is occupied by an opponent with a vacant square beyond, the checker must be jumped over and captured and removed from the board. If the landing square presents the same situation, successive jumps in a straight or zigzag direction must be completed in the same play. The one exception is that when an uncrowned man moves or jumps into the king row, it can't leave until the next turn. When there is more than one way to jump, you can choose which jump to take. You cannot jump over your own men. When a checker reaches the opposite side of the board, the man is crowned and becomes a king. On subsequent plays, a king can move or jump in any diagonal direction on the board. The must-jump rule is often unknown to new or casual players of the game. The rule, however, is integral and important in game strategy.
